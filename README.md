# welcome
hello and welcome to marlet's crazy library! This is a library of cool scripts and bookmarklets I've found on the internet over the past months. **None of these are created by me and I do NOT take credit**
## notes 
- the first thing you need to know is that NONE of these bookmarklets are made by me except a few. Some bookmarklets may say "made by me" but that's just the original creator of the bookmarklet saying that it was made by them
- I will soon be adding the folders and automatic version updating so that you dont constantly need to reinstall and uninstall versions :) 
- use with common sense if you are in school, remember to respect your teachers. (if your just looking for something fun at home or have perms in school, it's fine.)
## how do I install it?
- go to the `install` folder and then find the version you would like to use (recommended is the latest version). 
- Click that version, and you should see something like `Marlet's crazy library`. 
- Click that file, then right click the raw button and hit `Save link as`.
- Right click your bookmarks bar and hit bookmarks manager. 
- Then click import, find the link you downloaded, and then open. There should be a folder called `Imported` when you import it. 
- Simply find `Marlet's crazy library` from there and drag it to your bookmarks bar

## how do I collaborate?
In order to collaborate, all you need to do is just send an email to me (24kpunkdogs@gmail.com) with the code and nmae for your bookmarklet. The library is updated every one or two months, meaning that I will take requests 1-2 months after an update, then add the requests after those months. After I add those requests, the same process will happen again
