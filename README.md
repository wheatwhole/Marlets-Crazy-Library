# welcome
hello and welcome to marlet's crazy library! This is a library of cool scripts and bookmarklets i found over the past months. None of these are created by me and all credit is given to the original owners. Have fun!
## notes 
- the first thing you need to know is that NONE of these bookmarklets are made by me except a few. Some bookmarklets may say "made by me" but that's just the original creator of the bookmarklet saying that it was made by them
- I will soon be adding the folders and automatic version updating so that you dont constantly need to reinstall and uninstall versions :) 
- use with common sense if you are in school, remember to respect your teachers. (if your just looking for something fun at home or have perms in school, it's fine.)
## changelog
Since Marlet's Crazy Library is just starting out, we are in v1 with many bookmarklets! If you would like to contribute you can DM me on discord at lordwaffles#6096. Since im new to this whole github thing, it may take me some time to add you as a contributor
+ v1 - added a large amount of bookmarklets, including a special bookmarklet section only for people with permission.
## how do I install it?
go to the `versions` folder and then find and download the version you would like to use. After that type the url chrome://bookmarklets in your URL bar and then click the three dots at the top, click the import bookmarks button to import the bookmarks. If there are any errors with it such as it not being organized into folders then just message below. Dont worry, soon there will be automatic updating and all bookmarklets will be added to repositiory.
## catagories
### minecraft
a catogory with minecraft multiplayer servers and java edition! (These servers will work on any device including chromebooks). Remember to only play if your teacher allows to or if you have freetime. This is one of my favorite parts of the library
### experimental
bookmarklets that may or may not soon be added to the library. some of these bookmarklets may not work since they are being tested to see if they can be added.
### fun!
explore some pretty fun bookmarklets! (Be wary of bookmarklets that say stuff like pain, annoying, infinite tabs)
### utility
calculator, font checker, youtube video downloader, password generator, gmail sender, and much more!
### evilscript
just a random catagory of bookmarklets made for pranking people.
### unsafe!
these bookmarklets may be unsafe to use and not even i use them because of how they could get you in trouble (in school). For example, the `tab cloaks` folder inside the `unsafe` folder has a list of bookmarklets that change your tab to a different name, with some of these being bad ones lol. not really THAT unsafe though, since all it has is a tiny tab keeper and an extension installer.
